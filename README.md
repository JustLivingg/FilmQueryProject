## Film Query App

#### Project Description
This program asks user to choose from a menu of 3 items using scanner input.
Your 3 choices are:
- Choose Film by ID.
- Choose Film by search word.
- Exit application.

Both option 1 and option 2 are in a while loop switch statement, so after providing information, it will take you back to the menu until you tell the application to quit.

This application uses:
- OOP design
- mySQL databases
- Interfaces

#### Things struggled with and gave me headaches.
I had two major issues while attempting this homework assignment. I first got stuck on  creating my menu. I created my menu and tried to search for film by id and got stuck in a never ending loop always choosing menu item 1 when I would use scanner input and choose film id 1. I realized I had to make another method that would be called by choosing menu item 1 that would direct me to finding the film instead.

The 2nd part of the homework that I got stuck on was getting the language name to appear instead of language ID. You just have to fix your String SQL to be what you want. The littlest things can cause the biggest headaches if you over look them.
